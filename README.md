# Project 3 - Twitter

**Name of your app** is a basic twitter app to read your tweets.

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

This app is built on Twitter's API; it is able to allow the user to login to their Twitter account, and when the user closes the app, it is able to remember if the user was logged in or not. The app is able to load tweets from the Users timeline: the persons profile image, the name of their profile and the content of their tweet. The user can pull down at the top of the screen to load in more recent tweets and the user can infinitely scroll. Finally, as a bonus feature, I was able to load in the total number of favorites and retweets each tweet has gotten.
